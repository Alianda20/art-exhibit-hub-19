/**
 * Notes on WhatsApp Business API integration:
 * 
 * To fully implement this feature in production, you'll need to:
 * 
 * 1. Sign up for WhatsApp Business API access through Meta or an official Business Solution Provider
 * 2. Set up a webhook to receive messages
 * 3. Create message templates for automated responses
 * 4. Use the API to send messages to your admin number
 * 
 * Additionally, you could extend this functionality by:
 * - Creating a dashboard for managing WhatsApp conversations
 * - Storing conversation history in your database
 * - Adding more sophisticated AI/ML for better FAQ matching
